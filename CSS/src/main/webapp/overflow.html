 ADAM SMITH would be baffled by
			microelectronics. When the great economist died in 1790 James Watt’s
			two-cylinder steam engine passed for the height of technological
			sophistication. If he recognised the prefix “nano”—a fair bet for a
			precocious classicist proficient in dead languages by 14—it would be
			as a derivation of the Greek word for “dwarf”, not as a reference to
			the billionths of a metre in which modern semiconductors are
			measured. The word “billion” had entered the English language by
			Smith’s time but the number it denotes would have seemed
			unfathomable. Some 200bn transistors etched onto a few halfpennies in
			Nvidia’s latest Blackwell artificial-intelligence (AI) chip? Black
			magic, even for an enlightened Scottish rationalist.
