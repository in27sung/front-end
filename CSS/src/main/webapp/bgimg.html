			New Zealand's parliament was
			brought to a temporary halt by MPs performing a haka, amid anger over
			a controversial bill seeking to reinterpret the country's founding
			treaty with Māori people. Opposition party MP Hana-Rawhiti
			Maipi-Clarke began the traditional ceremonial group dance after being
			asked whether her party supported the bill, which faced its first
			vote on Thursday. At the same time, a hīkoi - or peaceful protest
			march - organised by a Māori rights group is continuing to make its
			way towards the capital, Wellington. Thousands have already joined
			the 10-day march against the bill, which reached Auckland on
			Wednesday, having begun in the far north of New Zealand on Monday.
